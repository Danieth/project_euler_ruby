## Danieth's Project Euler Solutions ##
My latest solutions to ProjectEuler problems (in ruby)

All solutions are algorithmically efficient (ignoring some number fiddling I don't want to deal with) and run under 1 minute. Although I have solved more problems than listed in this repository they have been in other languages (Java, Scala, Elixir) and many have been lost over the years.
