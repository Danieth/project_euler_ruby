# ruby_project_euler_solutions
My latest solutions to ProjectEuler problems (in ruby)

All solutions are very efficient (given the ruby runtime) and run under 1 minute. Although I have solved more problems than listed in this repository they have been in other languages (Java, Scala, Elixir) and many have been lost over the years.
